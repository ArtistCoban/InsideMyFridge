# 🍽️ InsideMyFridge

**InsideMyFridge is a recipe suggestion app made by a university student (me).**
You write what ingredients you have in your fridge, and it shows you recipes that match — even if it's not an exact match (fuzzy style).

Built using **FastAPI** in Python and some basic HTML/JS for the frontend.

## 📦 Data Source

I used [Kaggle’s Food.com Recipes and Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews).
I filtered it down to about 90,000 recipes, cleaned the data, and converted it to a simple JSON file to use locally.

## 🔎 What It Can Do

* You type some ingredients, like: `egg, tomato`
* It searches through the dataset and gives you recipes
* It doesn't need exact matches (so "tomatoes" and "tomato" work)
* Clean and simple design
* Lightweight project, perfect for learning

## 🧠 Tools I Used

* 🐍 Python 3
* ⚡ FastAPI
* 📁 JSON (for the recipe data)
* 🌐 HTML + JavaScript (basic stuff)
* 🐧 Works fine locally, but can also be deployed on [Render](https://render.com)

## 🛠️ How to Run It Locally

### 🔸 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

### 🔸 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then go to:
📍 `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 🔸 3. Open the Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser. That's it!
